	abstract = {Background
Detecting candidate markers in transcriptomic studies often encounters difficulties in complex diseases, particularly when overall signals are weak and sample size is small. Covariates including demographic, clinical and technical variables are often confounded with the underlying disease effects, which further hampers accurate biomarker detection. Our motivating example came from an analysis of five microarray studies in major depressive disorder (MDD), a heterogeneous psychiatric illness with mostly uncharacterized genetic mechanisms.

Results
We applied a random intercept model to account for confounding variables and case-control paired design. A variable selection scheme was developed to determine the effective confounders in each gene. Meta-analysis methods were used to integrate information from five studies and post hoc analyses enhanced biological interpretations. Simulations and application results showed that the adjustment for confounding variables and meta-analysis improved detection of biomarkers and associated pathways.

Conclusions
The proposed framework simultaneously considers correction for confounding variables, selection of effective confounders, random effects from paired design and integration by meta-analysis. The approach improved disease-related biomarker and pathway detection, which greatly enhanced understanding of MDD neurobiology. The statistical framework can be applied to similar experimental design encountered in other complex and heterogeneous diseases.},

	abstract = {It has unambiguously been shown that genetic, environmental, demographic, and technical factors may have substantial effects on gene expression levels. In addition to the measured variable(s) of interest, there will tend to be sources of signal due to factors that are unknown, unmeasured, or too complicated to capture through simple models. We show that failing to incorporate these sources of heterogeneity into an analysis can have widespread and detrimental effects on the study. Not only can this reduce power or induce unwanted dependence across genes, but it can also introduce sources of spurious signal to many genes. This phenomenon is true even for well-designed, randomized studies. We introduce âsurrogate variable analysisâ (SVA) to overcome the problems caused by heterogeneity in expression studies. SVA can be applied in conjunction with standard analysis techniques to accurately capture the relationship between expression and any modeled variables of interest. We apply SVA to disease class, time course, and genetics of gene expression studies. We show that SVA increases the biological accuracy and reproducibility of analyses in genome-wide expression studies.},

We also compared them against no outlier removal and random array removal. We find that removing outlier arrays can improve the signal-to-noise ratio and thus strengthen the power of detecting differentially expressed genes. Using array weights is similarly effective, but its applicability is more limited. The quality metrics presented here are implemented in the Bioconductor package arrayQualityMetrics.},

It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

	abstract = {In this paper we report exploratory analyses of high-density oligonucleotide array data from the Affymetrix GeneChip system with the objective of improving upon currently used measures of gene expression. Our analyses make use of three data sets: a small experimental study consisting of five MGU74A mouse GeneChip arrays, part of the data from an extensive spike-in study conducted by Gene Logic and Wyeth's Genetics Institute involving 95 HG-U95A human GeneChip arrays; and part of a dilution study conducted by Gene Logic involving 75 HG-U95A GeneChip arrays. We display some familiar features of the perfect match and mismatch probe (PM and MM) values of these data, and examine the variance-mean relationship with probe-level data from probes believed to be defective, and so delivering noise only. We explain why we need to normalize the arrays to one another using probe level intensities. We then examine the behavior of the PM and MM using spike-in data and assess three commonly used summary measures: Affymetrix's (i) average difference (AvDiff) and (ii) MAS 5.0 signal, and (iii) the Li and Wong multiplicative model-based expression index (MBEI). The exploratory data analyses of the probe level data motivate a new summary measure that is a robust multi-array average (RMA) of background-adjusted, normalized, and log-transformed PM values. We evaluate the four expression summary measures using the dilution study data, assessing their behavior in terms of bias, variance and (for MBEI and RMA) model fit. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms in terms of their ability to detect known levels of differential expression using the spike-in data. We conclude that there is no obvious downside to using RMA and attaching a standard error (SE) to this quantity using a linear model which removes probe-specific affinities.},

	abstract = {One of the most common analysis tasks in genomic research is to identify genes that are differentially expressed (DE) between experimental conditions. Empirical Bayes (EB) statistical tests using moderated genewise variances have been very effective for this purpose, especially when the number of biological replicate samples is small. The EB procedures can however be heavily influenced by a small number of genes with very large or very small variances. This article improves the differential expression tests by robustifying the hyperparameter estimation procedure. The robust procedure has the effect of decreasing the informativeness of the prior distribution for outlier genes while increasing its informativeness for other genes. This effect has the double benefit of reducing the chance that hypervariable genes will be spuriously identified as DE while increasing statistical power for the main body of genes. The robust EB algorithm is fast and numerically stable. The procedure allows exact small-sample null distributions for the test statistics and reduces exactly to the original EB procedure when no outlier genes are present. Simulations show that the robustified tests have similar performance to the original tests in the absence of outlier genes but have greater power and robustness when outliers are present. The article includes case studies for which the robust method correctly identifies and downweights genes associated with hidden covariates and detects more genes likely to be scientifically relevant to the experimental conditions.

However, the mechanisms by which each proteinopathy leads to neurodegeneration remain elusive. We hypothesized that there is a common "pan-neurodegenerative" gene expression signature driving pathophysiology across these clinically and pathologically diverse proteinopathies. To test this hypothesis, we performed a systematic review of human CNS transcriptomics datasets from AD, LBD, and ALS-FTD patients and age-matched controls in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and ArrayExpress databases, followed by consistent processing of each dataset, meta-analysis, pathway enrichment, and overlap analyses. After applying pre-specified eligibility criteria and stringent data pre-processing, a total of 2600 samples from 26 AD, 21 LBD, and 13 ALS-FTD datasets were included in the meta-analysis. The pan-neurodegenerative gene signature is characterized by an upregulation of innate immunity, cytoskeleton, and transcription and RNA processing genes, and a downregulation of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Pathway enrichment analyses also revealed the upregulation of neuroinflammation (including Toll-like receptor, TNF, and NFÎºB signaling) and phagocytosis, and the downregulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, lysosomal acidification, and ubiquitin-proteasome pathways. Our findings suggest that neuroinflammation and a failure in both neuronal energy metabolism and protein degradation systems are consistent features underlying neurodegenerative diseases, despite differences in the extent of neuronal loss and brain regions involved.},

One of the key problems in genomics is the identification and estimation of factors that associate with many features simultaneously. Identifying the number of factors is also important for unsupervised statistical analyses such as hierarchical clustering. A conditional factor model is the most common model for many types of genomic data, ranging from gene expression, to single nucleotide polymorphisms, to methylation. Here we show that under a conditional factor model for genomic data with a fixed sample size, the right singular vectors are asymptotically consistent for the unobserved latent factors as the number of features diverges. We also propose a consistent estimator of the dimension of the underlying conditional factor model for a finite fixed sample size and an infinite number of features based on a scaled eigen-decomposition. We propose a practical approach for selection of the number of factors in real data sets, and we illustrate the utility of these results for capturing batch and other unmodeled effects in a microarray experiment using the dependence kernel approach of Leek and Storey (2008, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 105, 18718-18723).},
